### Technologies Used

### Description
This project proposes the development of UniVibe — a dynamic web application designed to bridge the communication gap between university societies and students.
For societies, UniVibe will serve as a centralized platform to:
- promote events,
- post event details, and
- share media such as videos and photos.
  
For students, it will be a one-stop hub to
- explore societies,
- view event histories, media, and
- receive important updates — all without the fear of missing out due to cluttered inboxes.
  
By enabling students to subscribe to their favorite societies, UniVibe ensures that all relevant updates are delivered directly and neatly, creating a seamless experience for both ends.
